/*
 * Burst state machine for monitor mode.
 *
 * Sampling never stops: every DMA period is scanned (see idle.h), and this
 * decides what to write. While the bus is quiet nothing is written, so an idle
 * hour costs no disk. When a change appears, the burst starts `pre` samples
 * before it, taken from the caller's pre-roll ring, and ends `post` samples
 * after the last change once `gap` samples have passed with no change.
 *
 *   waiting --change--> recording --gap with no change--> end (keep up to post)
 *
 * All positions are absolute sample numbers since the capture began. Pure
 * logic: no I/O, no allocation.
